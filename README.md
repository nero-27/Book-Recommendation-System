# Book-Recommendation-System

This project is a 4th year project of Computer Engineering. It was implemented by a group of 4 people.

Book Recommendation System recommends books to the user based on their ratings. 
The user must first create and account in order to use the system. 
The user may search any book to read information about the book and also rate the book on a scale of 1-10. 
The recommendations are generated using Item-based Collaborative Filtering Technique using the ratings given to books by users.

The project is a web application and implemented using django framework.
